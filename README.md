 What This Project Does

                     Handles missing values

                     Fixes naming issues

                     Removes duplicates

                     Cleans & formats messy columns

                     Exports a polished cleaned CSV


How to Run

 
           pip install pandas
      
           python clean_data.py

purpose

      Perfect for beginners learning data cleaning, Pandas basics, and preparing datasets for analysis.


## Sub Task 2.3

Transform & Conquer

                   A beginner-friendly project demonstrating how to filter, sort, and aggregate data using Python and Pandas.
             
                   Turn raw tables into meaningful insights like average sales, top performers, and more.

What This Project Does

                     Filters rows based on conditions

                     Sorts data for quick insights

                     Aggregates values (sum, mean, max, etc.)

                     Creates small summary reports

                     Outputs clean, insight-ready tables


How to Run
            
            pip install pandas
            
            python transform.py
            
 Purpose

           Great for learning Pandas transformations and building analysis-ready datasets.
